### Fade in:

### Ext. Suburban Home - night

We open on a modern suburban home. The front window illuminated by the lights inside. We see the silhouette of a small human figure as it runs back and forth. We push in closer as we slowly see a BOY running around the house.

### Cut to:

2 Int Suburban home - kitchen - Night

*A green ball* sits on a counter top. A young hand snatches it. It belongs to FILBERT (9), wiry, lost in his own imaginary world. Dressed as a knight. A toy sword in his other hand.

Filbert (V.O.)
: This is my castle. I am sworn to protect it. Anyone that stands in my way shall bear the wrath of the almighty--

Just then, the babysitter walks by. BECKY (23), trendy, distracted. She is mid-phone call with Filbert's Mom, TRACY.

Becky
: Oh yeah, he's fine. He's just fighting orcs and trolls.
